Overview
Portal Pandemonium is an innovative platform fighter that aims to balance the playing field between novice and expert players. The game focuses on weapons and portals, moving away from traditional melee combat. With its unique one-hit-kill mechanism, Portal Kombat ensures that even less skilled players have a chance to win rounds against more experienced opponents.

Team Composition
Jacob: Team Leader Oversees the entire project Responsible for general code development Coordinates team efforts and makes key decisions

Han: Weapons System Developer Develops and implements weapon-related code

Chao: Portal System Developer Creates and maintains the portal system code Implements portal functionality and related feature

Key Features
• Quick Rounds: Matches last between 5-30 seconds, minimizing wait times for eliminated players. • One-Hit Kills: All weapons eliminate players in a single hit, giving everyone a fighting chance. • Weapon and Powerup System: Players can pick up various weapons and powerups, but can only hold one of each type at a time. • Balanced Gameplay: The game is designed to reduce the skill gap while still rewarding experienced players. Gameplay Mechanics Movement • Basic left and right movement • Crouch: Allows players to duck under projectiles and melee attacks • Jump: Standard jump and double jump abilities • Fists: A melee slap attack that causes knockback (increased effectiveness with repeated hits)

Weapons
Weapons have limited ammo and require reloading. They despawn when out of ammo. Available weapons include: • Pistol • Mine (motion-activated) • Impact grenade • Sword (melee attack) • Death ray (pierces through walls) • Shotgun (short-range burst) • Machinegun

Powerups
Powerups must be manually activated and are single-use. Some come with trade-offs, such as temporarily disabling jumping or shooting. Available powerups include: • Barrage shield • Dash • Speed boost • Melee knockback boost • Jetpack

Development Status
The game is currently in development, with regular playtests being conducted to refine gameplay and balance.

Current Focus
• Implementing all assigned features from previous iterations • Developing additional levels for playtesting • Refining weapon and powerup mechanics • Balancing gameplay to ensure fairness between novice and expert players

Note on Powerups
While powerups are listed in the game design, they may be cut from the initial release to focus on core gameplay elements. The development team will make decisions on feature inclusion based on playtesting results and development progress.

Next Steps
• Conduct additional playtests to gather feedback • Implement feedback from previous playtests • Continue level development • Refine weapon mechanics and balance • Prepare for upcoming milestone presentations
